# Front-End-Clocks
An analog and digital clock showing the current time written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to add to your webpages.

Each of the two clocks contain an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file.  Make sure you grab all three for each clock type.  The JavaScript is fully written and functional; it's not necessary to edit any of it except for adding additional functionality.  Any design changes can be made to the CSS and HTML files.  Altering the HTML IDs will break the JavaScript if it is not properly updated to match.
